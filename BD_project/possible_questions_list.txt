It starts with one...

- What is the trend of new tech vs established tech meetups? (e.g. number of meetups about C++ vs. Rust)
- What are some of the most common meetup topics? (e.g. Gaming vs. Professional Development, Big Data vs. Automation, Workshops vs. Seminars?)
- What is the most popular time when events are created? (Find local_time/date)
- Which event has the most RSVPs?
- Are events with longer durations more popular vs shorter ones?
- How many events were created (or will be hosted) for each months?
- (if good historical data is available) what is the growth rate of some specified topics in a city over time?
- Which cities hosted the most tech based events (if we can get good historical data)?
- How many upcoming events are online compared to in person ones (and what cities have the most upcoming in person events)?
- Prevalence of different payment options.
- How has the capacity (rsvp_limit) changed over time?
- Has there been a change in planning times for events? (time - created)
