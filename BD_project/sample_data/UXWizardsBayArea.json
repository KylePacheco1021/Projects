Friends are welcome, and it's open skate so all experiences are welcome as well (they will even give you a stack of buckets to skate with if needed)</p> <p>You are also welcome to join us for dinner beforehand, just let me know by 3pm day of so I can make it happen (reservations and whatnot, dinner location TBD) We will most likely be at the rink until 9:30! We will either have glow necklaces or Hawaiian leis--still undecided but I'll find a way of making us identifiable :D</p> <p>Admission is $11.50, and you can rent skates for $5<br/>The address for the ice skating rink is:</p> <p>1500 South Tenth Street<br/>San Jose, California 95112</p> ",

Celebrate the holidays with us by grabbing a burger (or a happy hour snack or drink depending on how you feel) with us at this awesome new burger place in Santa Clara. Food and drinks can be purchased at the bar and they'll bring it to the table. Also there's plenty of parking! Looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>PS Totally ok to bring a +1 or non UX friend, this gathering is open to all! No real agenda for the evening, although I'm bringing some post-it notes to collect ideas for the upcoming an upcoming portfolio workshop if we have any down time (but if we don't get to that it's totally ok too!)

This is basically a study session to get work done on your portfolio by actually setting aside time to do it, but with friends who are in the same boat! This event is self-guided and work-at-your-own-pace, so come with your laptop and let this be your motivation to do the thing you kept telling yourself you'd work on \"someday\".</p> <p>As this will be our first session, I expect we will have many questions (Where should I host? What should I include?). Please be open to discussing these questions as a group and possibly doing some Google-ing as a team to find out the answers. As we continue to do more of these, we can learn and be able to tell others what we found out, making these sessions more streamline and productive.</p> <p>LOCATION:<br/>We will be using the study room in the back of TOM N' TOMS coffee.

If you have little or no familiarity with prototyping with Adobe XD but were always curious, this is the session for you! Brian and Phi are going to walk you through two easy prototyping exercises using XD and Auto-animate, that will bring a lot of flexibility and style to your prototypes. Bring your laptops with Adobe XD installed (if you forget, we should have some time at the beginning to install, but save yourself some angst and come prepared if at all possible!) We'll do two quick prototyping demos, and answer any questions! Looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>We'll meet at 6pm, likely spend the first half hour getting settled in and start our prototyping at 6:30pm. We are expected to be done around 7 or 7:15 and will leave the rest of the hour up for questions and project work so you can put your new Auto Animate skills to good use!</p> <p>PS This is the first in our UX-ology guided series. If you have a favorite tool that you'd like to see a demo on, please get in touch.</p> <p>Keri</p> ",

In our first ever Meetaway, you will have the chance to match with at least 7 designers around the world for 10 minutes each.</p> <p>HOW DOES IT WORK?<br/>Meetaways are online events that intelligently match attendees for a series of 1-on-1 video calls. After each conversation, attendees automatically rotate to the next one. You just log in to the event and Meetaway will handle the rest.</p> <p>WHY SHOULD I JOIN?<br/>Whether you are looking for your next job, exploring other companies, like brainstorming with others like you or you are just a beginner, this event is for you! Do not worry about your level of expertise, everyone has a story to tell.</p> <p>WHAT DO I NEED TO ATTEND?<br/>Laptop or desktop with Chrome or Firefox. Meetaway does not support mobile devices because the screen movements are often distracting and having everyone on a laptop or desktop results in a better overall experience for everyone.</p> <p>WHO ARE WE?<br/>We are UX Wizards of the South Bay, a designer community-based in the SF Bay Area. We are expanding our reach every day through meetups, events, workshops and online gatherings.

In our first ever Meetaway, you will have the chance to match with at least 7 designers around the world for 10 minutes each.</p> <p>HOW DOES IT WORK?<br/>Meetaways are online events that intelligently match attendees for a series of 1-on-1 video calls. After each conversation, attendees automatically rotate to the next one. You just log in to the event and Meetaway will handle the rest.</p> <p>WHY SHOULD I JOIN?<br/>Whether you are looking for your next job, exploring other companies, like brainstorming with others like you or you are just a beginner, this event is for you! Do not worry about your level of expertise, everyone has a story to tell.</p> <p>WHAT DO I NEED TO ATTEND?<br/>Laptop or desktop with Chrome or Firefox. Meetaway does not support mobile devices because the screen movements are often distracting and having everyone on a laptop or desktop results in a better overall experience for everyone.</p> <p>WHO ARE WE?<br/>We are UX Wizards of the South Bay, a designer community-based in the SF Bay Area. We are expanding our reach every day through meetups, events, workshops and online gatherings.

The smaller room conversations will be timed and 20 minutes, and there will be a moderator who can jump in and help with any technical difficulties or help you change rooms.

        "description": "<p>Hey UX Wizards! I hope all of you are staying safe and healthy. We are hosting a virtual movie night via Netflix party.</p> <p>Note: To be allowed entry into the Zoom call you must be a registered attendee.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>- Meet &amp; Setup<br/>- Watch!<br/>- Return to discuss</p> <p>Please leave a comment on what you would like to watch:</p> <p>1. Abstract Platon: Photography / 45 min<br/>Platon's fearless portraits capture the souls of world leaders and ordinary people. A shoot with Gen. Colin Powell provides a window into his process.</p> <p>2. Her / 125 min<br/>In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with \u201cSamantha,\u201d an insightful and sensitive artificial entity. \"Her\" writer and director Spike Jonze won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards in 2014.</p> <p>3. Lady Bird / 95 min<br/>Sacramento, California, 2002. Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) is in her final year of high school. She longs to leave Sacramento and go to college on the East Coast. However, her protective, obsessive mother, pessimistic at her chances, is determined to keep her in California, and ideally nearby to home. Lady Bird's final year of school will be one of discovery, new experiences and finding herself.</p> <p>SUGGESTIONS<br/>Give us suggestions for the next movie night!<br/><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sBURH0NFdVhAUMQMkm8KCp_lPAM39XkZ2erUV83jS6Y/edit?usp=sharing\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sBURH0NFdVhAUMQMkm8KCp_lPAM39XkZ2erUV83jS6Y/edit?usp=sharing</a></p> <p>HOW TO WATCH WITH US:</p> <p>To attend the event you will need to do the following:<br/>- Have an active Netflix subscription<br/>- Download the Netflix Party Browser extension before the event (<a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.netflixparty.com/</a>).</p> <p>Netflix Party is a viewing party experience that allows all of us to be synced up and communicate while media is playing. To get Netflix Party to work, we will provide a Netflix link that will have the URL to the chat room. After landing on the page, be sure to click on the Netflix Party extension on the top right corner of your browser to make it active.</p> <p>Common Netflix Party errors:</p> <p>1 Netflix Party will start playing the trailer for the show when the party is paused.<br/>Not being signed into Netflix before clicking on the Netflix Party link will make Netflix Party behave this way. If this happens, sign in to Netflix on one tab and open the party room on another.</p> <p>2 When joining a paused party, the show will autostart from the start or the point of pause.<br/>If this happens, refresh the browser and click on the Netflix Party extension.</p> <p>Feel free to drop into the call 15 minutes before if you don't feel comfortable with the technology. We are more than happy to help you!</p> <p>Thanks all!</p> ",

The videos are in 2-3 minute snippets.</p> <p>There are 5 main 'sections', and I expect we will cover about 2 sections per session, which ends up being about 30 minutes of video. So, we'll go over this material in 3 sessions.</p> <p>Please note, this is my first time doing this format so I appreciate your patience :)</p> <p>Note: the material we are watching is all available for free on YouTube, I just thought it would be fun to make a 'watch party' out of it.</p> <p>Details:<br/>We're going to be going through this playlist:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHjwuoik-ep0wH7DMnKKA7M5ulXqAuwfn\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHjwuoik-ep0wH7DMnKKA7M5ulXqAuwfn</a></p> <p>via Zoom video sharing.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing everyone!<br/>Keri</p> ",

To get Netflix Party to work, we will provide a Netflix link that will have the URL to the chat room. After landing on the page, be sure to click on the Netflix Party extension on the top right corner of your browser to make it active.</p> <p>Common Netflix Party errors:</p> <p>1 Netflix Party will start playing the trailer for the show when the party is paused.<br/>Not being signed into Netflix before clicking on the Netflix Party link will make Netflix Party behave this way. If this happens, sign in to Netflix on one tab and open the party room on another.</p> <p>2 When joining a paused party, the show will autostart from the start or the point of pause.<br/>If this happens, refresh the browser and click on the Netflix Party extension.</p> <p>Feel free to drop into the call 15 minutes before if you don't feel comfortable with the technology. We are more than happy to help you!</p> <p>Thanks all!</p> ",
